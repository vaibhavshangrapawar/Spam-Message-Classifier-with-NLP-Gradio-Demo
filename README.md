# Spam-Message-Classifier-with-NLP-Gradio-Demo
This project showcases a simple spam detection system built using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and traditional machine learning algorithms. It includes both the model development in a Jupyter Notebook and a web-based Gradio interface for live predictions.

# üîç Project Highlights:
Text preprocessing: cleaning, lowercasing, stopword removal, and punctuation filtering

Feature extraction: using CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer

# Model training with:

Multinomial Naive Bayes

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Performance evaluation: accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall

Interactive Web App built with Gradio for spam prediction

# üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack:
Python

scikit-learn

pandas, numpy

matplotlib / seaborn

Gradio (for web UI)

üìå Goals:
Learn practical NLP techniques using Python

Implement a working spam detection pipeline

Build an interactive UI for user input
